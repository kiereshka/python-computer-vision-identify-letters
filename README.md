Develop a program script that ensures the identification of binary images of 5 literals given by a raster matrix. 
For identification, synthesize, train, and apply an artificial neural network in a "raw" implementation of matrix operations. 
Justify the choice of architecture and the training algorithm for the neural network. 
Prove the functionality and efficiency of the synthesized neural network.
